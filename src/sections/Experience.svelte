	<h1>Experience</h1>
	<br />
	<p>
		Well... At the end of my Programming studies, I got a place as internship in INDRA (Spain) for about 3 months. The post was
		suposed to be about Java but they asked me if I would mind to "assist" them in some bank branch they had and I said yes
		sure.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>It was a bad idea</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Turns out that the bank branch works with COBOL... So they teached me COBOL in like a week and that's about it really...
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		It is extremely expensive to run a program to the Main Frame so most of the programs I wrote had to be checked by someone.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		At the end of the internship and after that pretty bad taste, I decided to create a massive app and make money from it...
		but it is much more complicated than anticipated and now I'm looking for a job.
